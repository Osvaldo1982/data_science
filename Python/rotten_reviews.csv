                                    JOKER is a beautiful but simplistically shallow tale of one man's downward spiral, tacked on to a recognisable cinematic icon. Todd Phillips's film is a Batmobile with the engine of a clown car.

                                    The whole damn thing is directed with such boldness and vision that Todd Phillips (yeah, the Hangover guy) should never look back again. A big-screen must see.

                                    Not only an intelligent throwback to the feel-bad shock cinema of the 1970s, Joker is all but unique in its social realism...

                                    For just over two hours we are forced into alignment with a monster. And, not only that, it wants us to unrepentantly side with him. It feels hyperbolic to say that this results in a terrible sense of inescapable unease when watching, but it's the truth.

                                    For what it is, it's gorgeously assembled, with a ragged jewel of a performance by Joaquin Phoenix at its center. The problem is, well, what it is... Joker ends up repeating itself and lap-dancing its same handful of nihilistic points again and again.
                                ","
                                    Ultimately, Joker blames society for its ""hero's"" unraveling, letting this maniac off the hook. Simplistic, yes. Reckless, undoubtedly. But not totally invalid.

                                    To celebrate ""Joker"" as the best of the year is akin to telling your friends of all the celebrities you met while walking through Madame Tussauds. It isn't and you didn't.

                                    Phoenix overcomes the self-pity inherent in the material; he gives Arthur a sweet soul, and makes it hard not to like him, and to cringe when you see his next humiliation coming. In that sense, Joker is compelling.

                                    Joker is dark enough that you'll appreciate stepping out of the theater and into the light.

                                    This film is a Joker cosplay more than Joker. A cipher elevated to saviour by the disenfranchised and angry. It's not only a bad joke, but it's also a sad joke.

                                    Joker is a decent movie. It has its strengths: Phoenix's tour de force performance and Hildur Guðnadóttir's score among them. But for all that, it's not really worthy of all the hand-wringing it's inspired.
                                ","
                                    Joker begs for understanding and kindness, of which there is hardly any in the film. Phoenix should finally win an Oscar for his performance. He is heartbreaking.
                                ","
                                    The result of these creative decisions, however, is that whatever power Joker, as a pop culture icon, might wield, Joker, as a movie, feels toothless.
                                ","
                                    Joker is an uncomfortable film that focuses on the beautiful cinematography and subtle dialogue to reflect on symbolic meanings and deeper thought of an individual's sanity.

                                    There are several outstanding moments, a particular favourite of mine being Fleck dressed in a red suit, full make up, dancing on the stairs to THAT song...

                                    Fleck is a literal amalgam of both Thalia and Melpomene, an intriguing interpretation that positions his internal tension as the source of Joker's madness.

                                    It's an incredibly heavy film. It's well done, but it's heavy and leaves the viewer feeling like they've just gone 10 rounds in a heavyweight boxing match. It's mentally exhausting and desperately dark.

                                    Joker doesn't understand its representation of violence because it doesn't know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets.
                                ","
                                    The film owes a great deal to Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur. Phoenix uses his body as a weapon, even before the transformation into the Joker.
                                ","
                                    Looking at Joker for a kind of microcosmic version of melodrama giving way in the end to something better, however inchoate, is absolute wishful thinking. But like I said before - it's the perfect Rorschach inkblot.
                                ","
                                    Phoenix supercharges this Martin Scorsese-lite polemic with a bombastic, electrifying portrayal of unyielding sympathy for Arthur, whose desperation to connect with others descends into despair.
                                ","
                                    The movie tells its story without apology, and Phoenix plays it to the serrated edge, conjuring a modern take on Milton's Paradise Lost, where we're asked to find sympathy for the devil after being cast out of heaven...
                                ","
                                    it is over before it begins because there is no other possible outcome than what we eventually arrive at, and Phillips and Silver don't give us an interesting enough trajectory to make up for that loss
                                ","
                                    If Arthur Fleck reflects the same cultural alienation that creates mass shooters and serial killers, the movie cuts away too often to establish a cogent argument.
                                ","
                                    Todd Phillips can dump two cups of Taxi Driver into a bowl and slop in a cup and a half of The King of Comedy, but that doesn't make him Scorsese.

                                    It's hard to say if Joker entertains. It's dark and downbeat. There are good, even great, things about it, but overall it's just a little flat. It's one of those movies you can respect, though it's a little harder to like.
                                ","
                                    Like ""The Dark Knight"", this film demonizes the mentally ill. It also distorts NY realities in the early 80s.

                                    Phoenix's mesmerizing lead performance is more than enough to carry the narrative past many of its meandering moments.

                                    Watching Joaquin dance and evolve is enough to make this movie worth the time. Unfortunately, the third act that reaches beyond the character is not as successful.
                                ","
                                    In the end, we think we know how his story goes but the surprise is on us. [Arthur is] becoming (yikes, and gulp) likable, and maybe that's the most disturbing part of Joker.

                                    If you're a die-hard Batman fan, some things are definitely going to throw you off. If you're a casual comic fan, the performance is great and all-around it was chilling and tense.

                                    Phoenix's performance is something we're still talking about, which is rare these days...I've just had a lot of conversations, still, about this movie.

                                    In its depiction of Fleck's quixotic descent, Joker is as much about the spectators as it is about its tragic spectacle.

                                    As a nightmarish portrait of urban isolation and a gritty comic book origin story, the movie is superbly acted and tensely paced. It also lacks nuance and plays into well-worn tropes. It's good. It's not great.

                                    Joker has a very important message about mental illness, and everyone should watch it. Maybe it will make people think twice about how they treat others.

                                    Director Todd Phillips does not let up on the bleakness at any point. It is a film firmly grounded in humanity and ordinary and basic human vulnerabilities and needs in moments of challenge.

                                    Joker is a visual feast about mental illness, the crumbling of an unstable economic system, and toxic masculinity that thinks it has something groundbreaking to add to the comic book universe, but merely adds an obtuse reflection.

                                    Phoenix's Joker is a monster of his own making, and the film succeeds in blurring the lines between fantasy, reality, and hyper-reality, manipulating its audience to participate in the horror while challenging the individual's own mental soundness.

                                    Carried by a commanding, Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, Joker explores the darkest aspects of society and offers a window into the mental breakdown of a man who is pushed passed his breaking point.

                                    Joker is a testament to the power of the right actor to elevate occasionally shaky material to a gold standard. Joaquin Phoenix's humanity-laden performance is the perfect mix of futility and fury.

                                    The only thing wrong with 'Joker' is the commercial imposition that the main character has to become the Joker at the end. Absent that, it's actually a pretty good movie.

                                    Phillips and Silver have no interest in how [Arthur] can rid himself of the clutter that corrupts his existence. They're only interested in chaos; however, they don't elevate the chaos into a meaningful narrative, they pander to the audience with it.

                                    Phillips could have made a nip and tuck here or there to shave off run time, but he asks questions about society where no easy answers exist. In that respect, he makes ""Joker"" very much worth the time and money invested.

                                ","
                                    It's provocative, disturbing, occasionally funny, sometimes heartbreaking and the way Phillips plays with the intensity dial is incredible.

                                    Joker is a cautionary tale. It's saying, 'Don't create Jokers. They won't just go away if you ignore them.'
                                ","
                                    BRILLIANT. Joker goes too far, but intentionally so. For all the talk of ""inciting violence"", it's shocking that nobody is talking about this film's OTHER important messages.
                                ","
                                    I find it ridiculous that the same people who reject the notion of movies being responsible for inciting real-life violence are the ones panicking about Joker inspiring mass shooters.
                                ","
                                    Phillips has created a compelling character study with Phoenix's performance something that will be talked about for a long time.
                                ","
                                    Gritty and grubby, garish and loud, violent and depressing, Joker is a blunt instrument of a movie - though it is a good movie. Phoenix is superb, Arthur Fleck's downward spiral inverted into an ascent to antihero status as Gotham seethes then explodes.
                                ","
                                    This ""Joker"" doesn't care about the violence it perpetuates, but wants credit for pretending to care.
                                ","
                                    Like the anti-hero at its center, it's a movie trying so hard to be capital-b Big that it can't help looking small.
                                ","
                                    The Joker is deadly serious, a bleak but oddly beautiful horror film that evokes the nightmarish nihilism of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver.
                                ","
                                    A power and free film and almost improper of Hollywood in the times they are in. [Full Review in Spanish]

                                    Starting as a powerfully unsettling character study, it builds to the kind of corny and obvious finale you'd expect from, yes, a studio superhero movie.
                                ","
                                    Yes, this is the story of the birth of a popular super villain, but ""Joker"" has much bigger issues on its mind.
                                ","
                                    I didn't hate the movie. Actually, I think it's kind of great in many ways, but the things it does badly are tough to ignore...Joker is good. Not great, but certainly not a world-ending disaster.
                                ","
                                    It's interesting that Todd Phillips had to get so far away from the character to find the brightest way to put it on the screen. [Full review in Spanish]
                                ","
                                    Joaquin Phoenix isn't so much an actor as a moral contortionist in this mesmerising origin story.
                                ","
                                    Its themes will polarise audiences but there is no denying Philips' devastating reimagination of an iconic character. Along with Phoenix's staggering performance, this is one Joker that can be serious.
                                ","
                                    The best film of 2019. If Phoenix doesn't take home an Oscar the villains will be sitting on the Academy.
                                ","
                                    Joker... is, like the character at the centre of it all, hard to define, but leaves an indelible impression.
                                ","
                                    Forget the overhyped controversy, Joker is simply stupendous as entertainment and provocation, with a gut-punch performance by Phoenix that puts a horrifically human face on an iconic comic-book villain.
                                ","
                                    Joker is bold and provocative in measures that make even the grittiest superhero tentpoles seem safe. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation.

                                    A chilling masterpiece. Both disturbing and fascinating. Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary. [Full review in Spanish]

                                    Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker.

                                    If you want to watch a rejected loner with a history of trauma and a conflicted relationship with their mother make the world burn for how they were treated, try Carrie.

                                    We are here for a grim fairground ride and Joaquin Phoenix, whose title character kicks everything else into distant wings, spares no effort in keeping us diverted throughout.
                                ","
                                    It's gorgeous to look at and splendidly acted, but it works much better as a singular character study than as a broader sociopolitical drama.
                                ","
                                    ""Joker"" is on the surface the origin of a supervillain but more subtly an exploration of empathy and the personal impact of a society devoid of it.
                                ","
                                    Despite a strong performance from Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips' Scorsese-infused adaptation is less than the sum of its parts.

                                    Thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's Joker there is no excuse for not taking comics-inspired movies seriously. [Full review in Spanish]

                                    Despite Phillips' questionable and unwatched filmography, I found myself on board with his Joker flick.
                                ","
                                    Phoenix's Joker fashions everything, all the pain and frustration, into a weapon, the tip of a spear that can rally others who are feeling the same.
